# Credit Card Approval System

## Overview
Credit scorecards are essential tools in the financial industry, aiding in the evaluation of credit risk and facilitating informed decisions about credit card issuance. By analyzing personal data and historical information from credit card applicants, these scorecards predict the likelihood of future defaults. This helps banks decide whether to approve or decline credit card applications, enhancing objectivity and consistency in their decision-making process.

## Traditional and Modern Approaches
Traditionally, credit scoring models have employed logistic regression, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks and offers transparent parameter interpretation. These models often scale logistic regression coefficients by a factor (e.g., 100) for practicality. With advances in machine learning, more complex and accurate predictive methods—such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines—have been introduced. However, these approaches can sometimes lack transparency, making it challenging to provide clear explanations for application approvals or rejections to both customers and regulators.

## Project Objective
This project aims to predict credit card approval for new customers, focusing on identifying potential defaulters. By analyzing personal and historical credit data, we help banks make informed decisions about credit card issuance.

## Methodology
We have experimented with several models to identify the best-performing one for credit card approval prediction. The models have been evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Examination of personal data and historical credit information.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of traditional logistic regression with advanced machine learning models like Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Imbalance Handling**: Addressing dataset imbalance to improve model fairness and accuracy.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance the decision-making process for credit card issuance by employing both traditional and modern predictive models, ensuring both accuracy and fairness while maintaining transparency.

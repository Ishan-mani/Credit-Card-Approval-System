# Credit-Card-Approval-System
This project aims to predict credit card approval for new customers, focusing on identifying potential defaulters. By analyzing personal and historical credit data, we help banks make informed decisions about credit card issuance.

Overview
Credit scorecards are essential tools in the financial industry, aiding in the evaluation of credit risk and facilitating informed decisions about credit card issuance. By analyzing personal data and historical information from credit card applicants, these scorecards predict the likelihood of future defaults. This helps banks decide whether to approve or decline credit card applications, enhancing objectivity and consistency in their decision-making process.
